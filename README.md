# Accelerated Computing Project
Alexander Colatosti, Ian Cameron, Amelia Soon

### Problem Statement
The goal of our project is to detect road signs that are present on the side of a road.
We are using a video file of a car's perspective as it travels down a roadside, just
like a real-world autonomous vehicle would use. We are using the NVIDIA Jetson Orin Nano
to implement the object detection needed to successfully complete our goal.


### Proposed Solution


### Implementation of Solution
- Jetson properly configured
- Initial 

### Final Reflection and Learning Plan
